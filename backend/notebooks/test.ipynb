And look, when we say \"large\", these models can be tens of gigabytes in size and trained on enormous amounts of text data. We\\'re talking potentially petabytes of data here. So to put that into perspective, a text file that is, let\\'s say, one gigabyte in size, that can store about 178 million words. A lot of words just in one Gb.

LLM equals three things: data, architecture, and lastly, we can think of it as training. Those three things are really the components of an LLM. Now, we've already discussed the enormous amounts of text data that goes into these things.

And then this architecture is trained on all of this large amount of data. Now, during training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence. So, \"the sky is...\" it starts off with a with a random guess, \"the sky is bug\". But with each iteration, the model adjusts its internal parameters to reduce the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.

Well, for customer service applications, businesses can use LLMs to create intelligent chatbots that can handle a variety of customer queries, freeing up human agents for more complex issues.

I\\'m a senior manager of business strategy at IBM Research, and today I\\'m going to give a brief overview of this new field of AI that\\'s emerging and how it can be used in a business setting to drive value. Now, large language models are actually a part of a different class of models called foundation models. Now, the term \"foundation models\" was actually first coined by a team from Stanford when they saw that the field of AI was converging to a new paradigm. Where before AI applications were being built by training,'), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 60, 'start_timestamp': '00:01:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=60s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content=\"maybe a library of different AI models, where each AI model was trained on very task-specific data to perform very specific task. They predicted that we were going to start moving to a new paradigm, where we would have a foundational capability, or a foundation model, that would drive all of these same use cases and applications. So the same exact applications that we were envisioning before with conventional AI, and the same model could drive any number of additional applications. The point is that this model could be transferred to any number of tasks. What gives this model the super power to be able to transfer to multiple different tasks and perform multiple different functions is that it's been trained on a huge amount, in an unsupervised manner, on unstructured data.\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 120, 'start_timestamp': '00:02:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=120s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content='And what that means, in the language domain, is basically I\\'ll feed a bunch of sentences-- and I\\'m talking terabytes of data here --to train this model.

And I\\'m trying to get my model to predict the last word of the sentence based off of the words that it saw before. And it\\'s this generative capability of the model-- predicting and generating the next word --based off of previous words that it\\'s seen beforehand, that is why that foundation models are actually a part of the field of AI called generative AI because we\\'re generating something new in this case, the next word in a sentence. And even though these models are trained to perform, at its core, a generation past, predicting the next word in the sentence, we actually can take these models,'), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 180, 'start_timestamp': '00:03:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=180s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content=\"and if you introduce a small amount of labeled data to the equation, you can tune them to perform traditional NLP tasks-- things like classification, or named-entity recognition --things that you don't normally associate as being a generative-based model or capability. And this process is called tuning. Where you can tune your foundation model by introducing a small amount of data, you update the parameters of your model and now perform a very specific natural language task. If you don't have data, or have only very few data points, you can still take these foundation models and they actually work very well in low-labeled data domains. And in a process called prompting or prompt engineering, you can apply these models for some of those same exact tasks. So an example of prompting a model to perform a classification task\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 240, 'start_timestamp': '00:04:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=240s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content=\"might be you could give a model a sentence and then ask it a question: Does this sentence have a positive sentiment or negative sentiment? The model's going to try and finish generating words in that sentence, and the next natural word in that sentence would be the answer to your classification problem, which would respond either positive or negative, depending on where it estimated the sentiment of the sentence would be. And these models work surprisingly well when applied to these new settings and domains. Now, this is a lot of where the advantages of foundation models come into play. So if we talk about the advantages, the chief advantage is the performance. These models have seen so much data. Again, data with a capital D-- terabytes of data --that by the time that they're applied to small tasks, they can drastically outperform a model that was only trained on just a few data points. The second advantage of these models are the productivity gains.\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 300, 'start_timestamp': '00:05:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=300s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content=\"So just like I said earlier, through prompting or tuning, you need far less label data to get to task-specific model than if you had to start from scratch because your model is taking advantage of all the unlabeled data that it saw in its pre-training when we created this generative task. With these advantages, there are also some disadvantages that are important to keep in mind. And the first of those is the compute cost. So that penalty for having this model see so much data is that they're very expensive to train, making it difficult for smaller enterprises to train a foundation model on their own.\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 360, 'start_timestamp': '00:06:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=360s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content=\"They're also expensive-- by the time they get to a huge size, a couple billion parameters --they're also very expensive to run inference. You might require multiple GPUs at a time just to host these models and run inference, making them a more costly method than traditional approaches. The second disadvantage of these models is on the trustworthiness side. So just like data is a huge advantage for these models, they've seen so much unstructured data, it also comes at a cost, especially in the domain like language. A lot of these models are trained basically off of language data that's been scraped from the Internet. And there's so much data that these models have been trained on. Even if you had a whole team of human annotators, you wouldn't be able to go through and actually vet every single data point to make sure that it wasn't biased and didn't contain hate speech or other toxic information. And that's just assuming you actually know what the data is. Often we don't even know-- for a lot of these open source models that have been posted --what the exact datasets are that these models have been trained on leading to trustworthiness issues. So IBM recognizes the huge potential of these technologies.\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 420, 'start_timestamp': '00:07:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfIUstzHs9A&t=420s', 'title': 'What are Generative AI models?', 'video_id': 'hfIUstzHs9A'}, page_content=\"But my partners in IBM Research are working on multiple different innovations to try and improve also the efficiency of these models and the trustworthiness and reliability of these models to make them more relevant in a business setting.

Famously, we've seen foundation models for vision --looking at models such as DALL-E 2, which takes text data, and that's then used to generate a custom image. We've seen models for code with products like Copilot that can help complete code as it's being authored. And IBM's innovating across all of these domains.

When new content is created by artificial intelligence, it’s called generative AI. This could involve generating texts and images, as well as videos, music, or voices. To do this, you describe in a chat dialogue box what you want the AI to create. This description is called a \"prompt\".  The generative AI tools provide answers to all sorts of questions, summarise complex information, and generate diverse ideas quickly. Depending on how they\\'re used, they can create short stories, paintings, pieces of code, or even musical compositions. The foundation for this creation lies in large amounts of data that the AI system accesses to identify patterns and similarities. The content produced by the AI is new. It\\'s often impressive and challenging to distinguish from things humans have made. Generative AI can also be misused: in so-called \"deepfakes\" AI is utilised to produce  images or videos that seem real. AI-generated texts are also tough to recognise as machine-made. Moreover, the AI can provide answers that sound correct but are actually incorrect – this is called \"hallucinating\". The quality of what\\'s created depends on both the quality of the data used and the quality of the prompts given. To effectively utilise generative AI, we need to learn how to guide the tools with meaningful prompts and use them thoughtfully. Generative AI holds immense potential and can help us in many ways – such as serving as a writing or learning partner.

The people here who hold\\nthis lecture said to me, \"Oh, you are very low-tech\\nfor somebody working on AI.\" I don\\'t have any explosions\\nor any experiments, so I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to participate, I hope that\\'s okay.

And generative, this is the fun bit, we are creating new content that the computer has\\nnot necessarily seen, it has seen parts of it, and it's able to synthesise\\nit and give us new things. So what would this new content be? It could be audio, it could be computer code so that it writes a programme for us, it could be a new image, it could be a text, like an email or an essay\\nyou've heard, or video. Now in this lecture I'm only gonna be mostly focusing on text because I do natural language processing and this is what I know about, and we'll see how the technology works and hopefully leaving the\\nlecture you'll know how, like there's a lot of myth\\naround it and it's not,\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 120, 'start_timestamp': '00:02:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6R7Ym6Vy_I&t=120s', 'title': 'What is generative AI and how does it work? – The Turing Lectures with Mirella Lapata', 'video_id': '_6R7Ym6Vy_I'}, page_content='you\\'ll see what it does\\nand it\\'s just a tool, okay?

She was an American writer and she writes about\\nmemorabilia and customs, but she\\'s famous for her quotes. So she\\'s given us this\\nquote here that says, \"Yesterday\\'s history,\\ntomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift, and that\\'s\\nwhy it\\'s called the present.\" It\\'s a very optimistic quote. And the lecture is basically the past, the present,\\nand the future of AI. Okay, so what I want to\\nsay right at the front is that generative AI\\nis not a new concept.

And Google Translate\\nhas served us very well for all these years and nobody was making a fuss. Another example is Siri on the phone.

Okay, so, we are all familiar with that. And of course later on there\\nwas Amazon Alexa and so on. Okay, again, generative\\nAI is not a new concept, it is everywhere, it\\nis part of your phone. The completion when\\nyou're sending an email or when you're sending a text. The phone attempts to\\ncomplete your sentences, attempts to think like you\\nand it saves you time, right?

So what I'm telling you is that generative AI is not that new. So the question is, what\\nis the fuss, what happened? So in 2023, OpenAI, which is a company in California, in fact, in San Francisco. If you go to San Francisco, you can even see the lights\\nat night of their building. It announced GPT-4 and it claimed that it can\\nbeat 90% of humans on the SAT. For those of you who don't know, SAT is a standardised test that American school children have to take to enter university, it's an admissions test, and it's multiple choice and\\nit's considered not so easy.

Okay, aside from that, it can pass exams, we can ask it to do other things. So you can ask it to write text for you. For example, you can have a prompt, this little thing that you\\nsee up there, it\\'s a prompt. It\\'s what the human wants\\nthe tool to do for them. And a potential prompt could be, \"I\\'m writing an essay about the use of mobile\\nphones during driving. Can you gimme three arguments in favour?\" This is quite sophisticated. If you asked me, I\\'m not sure I can come\\nup with three arguments. You can also do, and these are real prompts\\nthat actually the tool can do.

The technology it turns\\nout is not extremely new or extremely innovative or extremely difficult to comprehend. So we'll talk about that today now. So we'll address three questions.

Right, so, all this GPT model variants, and there is a cottage industry out there, I'm just using GPT as an\\nexample because the public knows and there have been a lot of, you know, news articles about it, but there's other models, other variants of models\\nthat we use in academia.

Now this is a toy example, but imagine now that the\\ncomputer has seen a lot of text and it knows what words\\nfollow which other words. We used to count these things.

Based on my understanding of Google, this class will probably be removed from the shelves in 1 hour. And I actually found that the underlying conceptual knowledge taught in this class allowed me to better use tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard, and also helped me clear up things I didn't realize about AI machine learning and large language models.  a series of misunderstandings. So let’s start with the broadest question, what is artificial intelligence? I can only admit with embarrassment that I didn't know the answer before. Artificial intelligence, like physics, is an entire field of study. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, just like thermodynamics is a subfield of physics. One level further down is deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning, and deep learning models can be further divided into discriminative models,\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 60, 'start_timestamp': '00:01:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=60s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content=\"generative models, and large language models, or LLMs.  The technology behind applications such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, which we are all familiar with, also falls under deep learning, and lies at the overlap of LLM and generative AI. Can you please leave a message and tell me if you knew this before? Now that we have a preliminary understanding of the field as a whole and how the different disciplines relate to each other, let's look at some key points at each disciplinary level. Overall, machine learning is a program that uses input data to train a model.  The trained model can further make predictions based on new data. For example, if you use Nike sales data to train a model, then the model can predict the sales performance of Adidas' new shoes based on Adidas sales data.  The two most common types of machine learning models are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.  The most crucial difference between the two is that supervised learning uses labeled data,\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 120, 'start_timestamp': '00:02:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=120s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content=\"while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. In this supervised learning example, this scatterplot shows the relationship between a restaurant's individual bill totals and tip amounts. And the data is tagged.  The blue dots equal customer pick-up orders, and the yellow dots equal merchant delivery orders. In this way, using the supervised learning model, we can predict how much tip we will receive next time based on the total bill and whether the order is picked up or delivered . For unsupervised learning, we will see whether the original data can automatically form groups. For example, this graph shows the relationship between the number of years an employee has been employed in an enterprise and his/her salary income. We will see that this group of employees has a higher salary/year ratio than the group below. We also know that this data is unlabeled. If the data is tagged, we will see gender, years of experience, department, etc.  We can now use this unsupervised learning model to solve such problems, such as whether this newly hired employee is growing at a high speed?\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 180, 'start_timestamp': '00:03:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=180s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content=\"If they are in the left group, the answer is yes. If on the right, then no. Pro tip, there is one more significant difference between these two models. After a supervised learning model makes a prediction, it compares the prediction to the data used to train the model. If there is a difference between the two, it will try to reduce the difference, which is not the case with unsupervised learning models.

After having a basic understanding of machine learning, we can start to understand deep learning. Deep learning is actually a type of machine learning, which uses artificial neural networks to learn. Don't worry, you just need to know that artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain, and it probably looks like this, layers of nodes and neurons.  The more nodes and neurons there are, the more powerful the model is. Due to the existence of these neural networks, we can perform semi-supervised learning, which is to use a small part of labeled data\"), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 240, 'start_timestamp': '00:04:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=240s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content=\"and a large part of unlabeled data to train a deep learning model. For example, a bank may use deep learning models to detect fraud. The bank will take a moment to label 5% of the transaction data as fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Since banks do not have enough time and resources to label all data, the remaining 95% of transaction data is unlabeled data. The secret of this model is that it uses these 5% of labeled data to learn the basic concepts involved in a task, which are good, which are bad, okay. This model will apply the knowledge learned previously to the remaining 95% of unlabeled data, using this entire new data set to make predictions about future transactions. It's cool, but it's not over yet. There are two models of deep learning, namely discriminative model and generative model.

You now mark them as dogs or cats.  The discriminative model will learn the label of cat or dog. If you submit a picture of a dog, it will predict the label of this data point: a dog. Now we finally get to generative AI. Different from the discriminative model, the generative AI model learns the patterns of data. After it receives some input, for example, if we give it a text instruction, they will generate new content based on the patterns of the data they just learned .  Let’s take the animal example just now. These pictures or data points are not labeled as cats or dogs. The generative model will look for patterns. Oh, these data all contain two ears, four legs, and a tail. They like to eat dog food. Also barks.  When you ask it to generate something called a dog, the generative model will generate a brand new picture based on the rules it learned before. There is a simple method that allows us to easily identify whether a model is generative AI.'), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 360, 'start_timestamp': '00:06:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=360s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content='If the output is a number, a category (such as junk or not-spam), or a probability, it is not generative AI.  It is generative AI only when it generates natural language (text or speech), pictures, or sounds . Generative AI generates entirely new samples, similar to the data used to train it. Next, let’s talk about different types of generative AI models. Most of us are familiar with text conversion models like ChatGPT or Google Bard. Other common model categories include text-to-image models such as Midjourney, DALL·E, and stable diffusion. Not only can they generate images, but they can also edit them. Text-to-video models, oh no, they can generate and edit videos. For example, imagen video, CogVideo and this very creative name make a video. Text-to-3D models can be used to create game assets. A lesser-known example is OpenAI’s shap-e model. Finally, text-to-task models are trained to perform a specific task. For example, when you type'), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 420, 'start_timestamp': '00:07:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=420s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content='@Gmail ask you to summarize my unread emails, Bard will read through your inbox and summarize the contents of your unread emails. Next, let’s talk about large language models. Don’t forget that LLMs are also a subset of deep learning. Although there is some overlap between the two, LLMs and generative models are not the same thing. There is an important difference between them, that is, large language models are usually pre-trained with a large amount of data and then fine-tuned based on specific purposes. what does this mean? Suppose you have a pet dog, you can train it in advance to learn some basic commands, such as sit, come, lie down, and stay still.  Once he learns it, he becomes a good dog and a generalist. But if this good dog is to become a police dog, a guide dog, or a hunting dog, it will need to receive more specific training and be fine-tuned to become that special expert dog.  The same is true for large language models. They are first trained with some basic language processing skills, such as classifying text, answering questions, summarizing documents, and generating text,'), Document(metadata={'start_seconds': 480, 'start_timestamp': '00:08:00', 'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0QkCxoTHM&t=480s', 'title': 'Google’s AI Course for Beginners (in 10 minutes)!', 'video_id': 'Yq0QkCxoTHM'}, page_content=\"and then use smaller industry data sets to fine- tune these large language models into industry experts to solve specific industries.  issues such as retail, finance, medical and entertainment. In the real world, this may mean that large language models pre-trained by some large technology companies are fine-tuned by hospitals using their own medical data to improve the diagnostic accuracy of X-rays or other tests . It's a win-win situation because large companies spend billions of dollars to build a general model, or a large language model, and then sell those models to smaller organizations like retail, banks, hospitals, etc. Although they have professional industry data that can be used to fine-tune the model, they do not have enough resources to build their own large language model.

When new content is created by artificial intelligence, it’s called generative AI. This could involve generating texts and images, as well as videos, music, or voices. To do this, you describe in a chat dialogue box what you want the AI to create. This description is called a \"prompt\".  The generative AI tools provide answers to all sorts of questions, summarise complex information, and generate diverse ideas quickly. Depending on how they\\'re used, they can create short stories, paintings, pieces of code, or even musical compositions. The foundation for this creation lies in large amounts of data that the AI system accesses to identify patterns and similarities. The content produced by the AI is new. It\\'s often impressive and challenging to distinguish from things humans have made. Generative AI can also be misused: in so-called \"deepfakes\" AI is utilised to produce  images or videos that seem real. AI-generated texts are also tough to recognise as machine-made. Moreover, the AI can provide answers that sound correct but are actually incorrect – this is called \"hallucinating\". The quality of what\\'s created depends on both the quality of the data used and the quality of the prompts given. To effectively utilise generative AI, we need to learn how to guide the tools with meaningful prompts and use them thoughtfully. Generative AI holds immense potential and can help us in many ways – such as serving as a writing or learning partner.
